<!--
  The attributes in this XML file provide configuration information
  for the SampleSyncAdapter.

  We have two versions of this file - one here, and one in the
  xml-v11 directory (Honeycomb and beyond). This one specifies that
  the syncadapter does not support uploading (and thus the contacts
  associated with this syncadapter are not editable).  The SDK 11
  version of the file specifies that the adapter DOES support
  uploading, so the contacts on SDK 11 and greater are editable.
